# Coursera_Capstone
This repository is mainly used for the capstone project for Coursera courses

In this project I will try to find an ideal location for startups who want to locate at Zurich, Switzerland. The target stakeholders are companies/contractors who are interested in starting their own business in Zurich, Switzerland with the special consideration to attract quali-fied employees. Factors that will influence the business office selection are:

1. Number of existing restaurants/coffee-bar/supermarkets nearby
2. If there is a gym or sport center nearby
3. Is it convenient to take public transportation (By comparing the number of public transport stations nearby)

According to the GeoNames Geographical Database (The GeoNames Geographical Database 2019), basic geographical data can be obtained and transformed to data frame by using the library pandas. Folium will be used to visualize maps and the latitude and longitude values will be acquired by the using of geopy library. Of course, the Foursquare API will be used to explore the Zurich region and segment them. In the end, the ideal business office sites in Zurich for stockholders will be presented both descriptively and graphically.
